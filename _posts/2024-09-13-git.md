## .gitignore

**1.递归地配置gitignore**

在一个仓库中可以有多个.gitignore，其作用域为当前目录
|.gitignore
|dir1
|--.gitignore
|--subdir
|dir2

**2.忽略文件夹、通配符**

```
#file .gitignore

[./]dir/
```

**3.将已被add/commit的文件 ignored**

```
git rm --cached <file>
git commit -m "rm track"  //!!!!需要提交这个commit应用修改
//edit the .gitignore
//done
```

**4.注释**

\# 开头是注释，会被忽略

## 本地版本控制技巧

* 将本次修改 追加到上次 commit 

  `git commit --amend`

* 合并若干次commit 为一个（压缩版本记录，减少不必要的快照）

  `git rebase -i <commit id>`

  使用git的变基特性。 -i 功能提供一个交互性的vim编辑窗口，来对各条commit操作

  将这些commit 改为drop，即可删除记录

* 重建branch，删除所有commit

  ```
  git checkout --orphan tmp
  
  ```

  --orphan <new-branch>

  Create a new unborn branch, named `<new-branch>`, started from `<start-point>` and switch to it. The first commit made on this new branch will have no parents and it will be the root of a new history totally disconnected from all the other branches and commits.

  The index and the working tree are adjusted as if you had previously run `git checkout <start-point>`. This allows you to start a new history that records a set of paths similar to `<start-point>` by easily running `git commit -a` to make the root commit.

  This can be useful when you want to publish the tree from a commit without exposing its full history. You might want to do this to publish an open source branch of a project whose current tree is "clean", but whose full history contains proprietary or otherwise encumbered bits of code.

  If you want to start a disconnected history that records a set of paths that is totally different from the one of `<start-point>`, then you should clear the index and the working tree right after creating the orphan branch by running `git rm -rf .` from the top level of the working tree. Afterwards you will be ready to prepare your new files, repopulating the working tree, by copying them from elsewhere, extracting a tarball, etc.

## 远程版本控制与冲突管理

1. **pull冲突 ：refusing to merge unrelated histories**

    两个仓库拥有不同的开始点（unrelated histories），这意味着 `Git` 无法找到一个共同的祖先节点来执行常规的合并操作 

    解决方案：`git pull --allow-unrelated-histories`

    `fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories` 这个错误提醒我们在合并分支时应当谨慎行事，确保理解并尊重项目的历史演化路径。通过采取适当的解决策略，我们可以既保持 `Git` 仓库的清晰结构，又能满足项目整合的需求。

2. **git psuh 命令**

    ```
     git push [remote host] [<local branch> : <remote branch>]
     
     git push gt/*remote host*/  main/*local branch*/ 
    ```

3. **git push 参数**

    --branches (--all)

    Push all branches (i.e. refs under `refs/heads/`); cannot be used with other <refspec>.

    **--prune**

    **Remove remote branches that don’t have a local counterpart. For example a remote branch `tmp` will be removed if a local branch with the same name doesn’t exist any more. This also respects refspecs, e.g. `git push --prune remote refs/heads/*:refs/tmp/*` would make sure that remote `refs/tmp/foo` will be removed if `refs/heads/foo` doesn’t exist.**

    可以删除远程不必要的branch

    --mirror

    Instead of naming each ref to push, specifies that all refs under `refs/` (which includes but is not limited to `refs/heads/`, `refs/remotes/`, and `refs/tags/`) be mirrored to the remote repository. Newly created local refs will be pushed to the remote end, locally updated refs will be force updated on the remote end, and deleted refs will be removed from the remote end. This is the default if the configuration option `remote.<remote>.mirror` is set.

    镜像地将本地仓库push 到远程，这将覆盖远程所有commit和branch

    -d --delete

    All listed refs are deleted from the remote repository. This is the same as prefixing all refs with a colon.
